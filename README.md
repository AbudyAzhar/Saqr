This project aims to develop a real-time license plate recognition system to detect stolen or wanted cars. Using a YOLOv8 model deployed on a Raspberry Pi with a camera, the system captures live video feeds and accurately recognizes license plates. It supports both Arabic and English characters, making it suitable for Saudi plates.
